\arguments{
\item{params}{Original population and control parameters for the target species and control gear. See `load_pva_parameters`.}

\item{decision_csv}{(One of decision_csv or decision_list must be provided) Path to a csv file containing scenario-specific control parameters to be used in decision making. May be created with `decision_setup`.}

\item{decision_list}{(One of decision_csv or decision_list must be provided) An R list containing named parameters and associated values for each scenario. May be created with `decision_setup`.}

\item{custom_inits}{(Optional, invoked by the `rankUncertainty` function) A vector containing the names of which parameters, if any, should differ from the values provided in \code{pva.params}.}

\item{sens_percent}{(Optional, invoked by the `rankUncertainty` function) For the sake of sensitivity analysis, how much should population parameters (i.e. \code{}, \code{}, \code{}, \code{}, \code{}, \code{}, \code{})}

\item{direction}{(Optional, invoked by the `rankUncertainty` function) Should biological parameters be increased or decreased by  `sens.percent`?}

\item{parallel}{(Optional), if TRUE decision simulations are run in parallel using  outputs are formatted with dollar signs and commas to "prettify")}

\item{pretty}{(Optional), if TRUE decision outputs are formatted as in the shiny app, with comma delimiters and dollar signs.}

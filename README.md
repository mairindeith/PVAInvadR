# PVAInvadR

PVAInvad.R is a population viability analysis simulator designed to quickly and accurately reflect uncertainty in the fate of invasive populations. Specifically, the software uses population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate how candidate removal strategies targeting different life stages will affect population persistence.

Users can provide a list of potential removal strategies, removal gears, or combinations of gears, and the model can run each and provide a multicriteria utility decision table where factors such as probability of eradication, cost and probabilistic range of abundance after a certain number of years are reported. Then, users can also explore the sensitivity of potential removal strategies to uncertainty in population parameters.

The model can be used for any species or population with indeterminate growth (e.g. most fish, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates). Populations are separated into two life stages: prerecruits and juveniles/adults. Pre-recruits are subject to density-dependent mortality and can in turn be separated into multiple stanzas, where the strength of density dependence in each stanza is user defined. Recruited animals are age-structured; mortality of these animals decreases with length. Age at recruitment can be adjusted and the number of stanzas can be increased to represent prolonged density dependent mortality over multiple juvenile ages.
